# validators - Python Data Validation for Humansâ„¢

Python has all kinds of data validation tools, but every one of them seems to
require defining a schema or form. I wanted to create a simple validation
library where validating a simple value does not require defining a form or a
schema.

```python
>>> import validators

>>> validators.email('someone@example.com')
True
```
